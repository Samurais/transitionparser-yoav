- to build using cython (use if you changed the .pyx file, or do not have the .c file for some reason):

   python setup.py build_ext --inplace

 (installing cython should be as easy as `easy_install cython`)

- if you don't care to install cython, you can build the .c file directly:
   rm -rf build
   python setupc.py install

 then copy the platform specific ml.so file from the build/*/ml.so directory to the ml/ directory.
